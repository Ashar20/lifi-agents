# Dune Rise Font

Download the DuneRise.ttf font from https://www.dafont.com/dune-rise.font and place it in this directory.

The font file should be named `dune_rise.ttf` to match the CSS font-face declaration in `index.css`.

If you don't have the font file, the styling will automatically fall back to the Cinzel font which provides a similar aesthetic.
